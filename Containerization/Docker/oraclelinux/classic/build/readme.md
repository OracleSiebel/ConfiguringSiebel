# Build

For a working siebel container, database connectivity is needed, so to start the process you need to [build a container for the database client](32-bit_instantclient_12c). From that base, you then [build each siebel container](base_siebel). Overtime, you may wish to [apply updates to the container](update) as they are released. Finally, we provide a [strategy for persistence using docker volumes](persistence).
