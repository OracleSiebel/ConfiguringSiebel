This collection of scripts is designed to aid you in launching and configuring the containers correctly. The [launch directory](scripts/automate-architecture/launch-siebel) example is something you can modify or duplicate to meet your needs.

Included are scripts for [launching the containers](scripts/automate-architecture/generic/container), and for [automated configuration](scripts/automate-architecture/smc) of the containers via REST calls.
